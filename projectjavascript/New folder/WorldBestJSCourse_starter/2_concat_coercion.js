//* Concatenation in JavaScript
//? In JavaScript, the + sign is not only used for arithmetic addition but also for string concatenation. When the + operator is used with strings, it concatenates the strings together.
//? It's important to note that if any operand of the + operator is a string, JavaScript will treat the other operands as strings as well, resulting in string concatenation. If both operands are numbers, the + operator performs numeric addition.

// const str = "Hello" + "World";
// console.log(str);

//* Type coercion is the automatic conversion of "values" from one data type to another.
//? It is a fundamental part of JavaScript and can be used to make code more readable and efficient.
//? There are two types of coercion in JavaScript: implicit and explicit. Implicit coercion happens automatically, while explicit coercion is done manually by the programmer.
//! It's worth noting that type coercion can lead to unexpected results, so it's essential to be aware of how JavaScript handles these situations.
